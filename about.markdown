Hi, I'm Albert, this is a website I made using Github Sitees and Jekyll! I'm a 2nd year student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. I love making things, taking on new projects and learning new skills along the way. This website is intended to be a testiment to that, a portfolio of sorts. Enjoy!
